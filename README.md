Implement a function pi_fraction that takes a float (gap) and returns a fraction that produces the closest approximation of pi to gap.

Example:

pi_fraction(1) # => 3.0 / 1.0 = 3.0

The specified gap is 1, which means that result of the fraction, 3.0, is closest to pi within the gap of 1.

Example 2:

pi_fraction(0.01) # => 22 / 7.0 = 3.142857142857143

The value of pi that's closest to within 0.01 of pi is 3.142857142857143
